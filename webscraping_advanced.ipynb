        "In the Web Scraping 101 tutorial, we used BeautifulSoup to turn HTML into a data structure that we could search and access using Python-like syntax. While it's easy to get started with this library, it has limitations when it comes to dynamic websites. That is, websites of which the content changes after each page refresh. Selenium can handle both static and dynamic websites and mimic user behavior (e.g., scrolling, clicking, logging in). It launches another web browser window in which all actions are visible which makes it feel more intuitive. For example, the video below launches a regular Google Chrome window and visits [`instagram.com`](https://www.instagram.com). This browser window behaves like normal, so you can click on buttons and fill out fields. Yet you can distinguish it from your normal web browser by the header that indicates that Chrome is being controlled by automated test software. Before you can try it out yourself, we need to install some additional software which we'll explain next. \n",

Download this file from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) (open [this](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-version-of-chrome-do-i-have) site in Chrome to identify your current Chrome version). \n",

If you click on the arrow pointing to the right, however, the 3rd image is loaded and becomes extractable in the code (see below). Extend the functionality of `scrape_image()` so that it scrapes all images. Your code should still work for a \"normal\" image (not a carousel). \n",

In particular, social network services rely on scrolling and clicking interactions to achieve this. As said many times before, this is just the beginning of your scraping journey. For example, see whether you can exploit Instagram's explore function to filter down on posts with a specific [tag](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tilburguniversity/)\n",
